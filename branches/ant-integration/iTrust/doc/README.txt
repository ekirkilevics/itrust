This is the README for the READMEs you are required to submit with each assignment.

Please place a README file in the /iTrust/doc/readme folder for each submission.

*** This file is here to help the grading of your assignment ***
*** PLEASE fill this out to help your grade!! ***

Use the file format of assignment_X.txt, where X is the assignment number.

Please note the following in your readme:
+ Anything that you did not finish
+ Any major design decisions you made; interpretations of the assignment that you think the TA should know about
+ The tests you added (doesn't need to be detailed, just the package and a few classes would suffice)
+ Anything else you think the TA should know about before grading

What is err.txt?
For testing purposes, we have created a mock object which mocks the System.out console print stream.
Err.txt is the file which results from the output of a few unit tests which use our mock object. This file 
will almost always be empty and it will get overwritten and rewritten every time you run your unit tests.
