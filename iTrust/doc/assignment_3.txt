3a) For the test data, we added transactionLog2, 3, and 4.sql in order to implement the scenarios
in the UC8 acceptance test plan.  TransactionLog2 and 3 are for test cases ViewAccessLogByDate
and ViewAccessLogByRole, respectively.  TransactionLog2 and 4 will be run sequentially for the
ViewLogWithUnauthorizedAccess test case.  The Representative database table is cleared and/or
filled for the second and third test cases, as required by preconditions.  The DeclaredHCP
table is updated for the second test case as well.

3b) For UC8, we added code in /auth/patient/viewAccessLog.jsp to allow sorting the transactions by date or role by
clicking on the hyperlinks in the headers of the table. One design decision that we made was to organize the 
roles in alphabetical order when a user chooses to sort by role.
We added the following UnitTest: edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.action.ViewMyAccessLogActionTest.testGetAccessesByRole() and edited
	-edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.dao.transaction.AccessRecordTest.java
	-edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.dao.transaction.TransactionDAOExceptionTest.java
We added the following HTTPUnitTests in edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.http.ViewAccessLogTest: 
	-testViewAccessLogByRole()
	-testViewAccessLogByDate()

For UC23, we changed/removed several JUnit and HttpTests to follow the new structure without admin approval.
These changes were in edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.action.ViewMyReportRequestsActionTest.java,
							edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.bean.ReportRequestBeanTest.java,
							edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.dao.reportrequest.ReportRequestDAOTest.java,
							edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.http.ComprehensiveReportingTest.java,
							and edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.http.ImmunizationUseCasesTest.java.
We added the following HttpUnit test: edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.http.ViewMyReportRequestsTest.java
