Most all this project ended up being in the jsp pages notificationArea 
(both in auth/patient and auth/hcp) which was included in home.jsp and
in viewAppt.jsp, which required some adjustment to handle looking at
representee's appointments instead of just one's own.

The decision was made to add getMonitoringHCPs() to the RemoteMonitoringDAO()
because it was required to know whether a patient was being monitored or not.
It was implemented in this way because this functionality might be useful in
the future and it seemed too specific just to have something which returned
the number of HCPs monitoring the patient.

Implemented getAppointments in ViewMyApptsAction so as to get the appointments
for an arbitrary MID.
