Homework 2.

For #3, CoffeeMaker and JUnit
Bug #1.
Inventory class method useIngredients() adds to the amount of coffee in the inventory instead of subtracting from the inventory the amount specified in the recipe. 

Tested with JUnit test class InventoryTest method testUseIngredients().

Bug #2.
Inventory class, method addSugar() does not add to the sugar object when the input is a positive integer, only a negative integer which is obviously wrong.

Tested with JUnit test class Inventorytest method testAddSugar().


For #10.
Design decisions:

	Enhanced getUserScript.jsp to work with input text boxes by removing the
	requirement to work with DOM elements of any name. Also added 
	correctness checking to prevent javascript undefined reference failures.

	Enhanced form validation and exception description for AppointmentRequestValidator.
		
New Tests:

	httptests/
	edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.http.appointment.lhcp AddAppointmentRequestHTTPTest

	Test for logging in new HCP with no appointments.
	
	edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.http EpidemicDetectionTest

	unittests/
	edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.action LabProcHCPActionTest
