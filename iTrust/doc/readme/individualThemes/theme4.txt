Old functionality:
the old strategy checked for valid domains where as the new strategy from EmailValidator doesn't check 
whether or not the domain name is valid or not.
		example:  invalid: google@google.google
					valid: google@google.com

the old strategy would kick back and error when encountering "andy.programmer?gmail.com" where as the new 
strategy for email refactoring just rejects the email as invalid.

the old strategy limited the length of the email sender to 30 characters where as the new strategy puts no limit
on the length of the email sender.	
		example:  rejected = googlegooglegoogle@google.com
					accepted = google@google.com
